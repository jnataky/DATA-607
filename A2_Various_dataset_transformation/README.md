The goal of this assignment is to give practice in preparing different datasets for downstream
analysis work.
tasks:

(1) Choose any three of the “wide” datasets identified in the Week 6 Discussion items. (You may
use your own dataset; please don’t use my Sample Post dataset, since that was used in your
Week 6 assignment!) For each of the three chosen datasets:
 Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information
included in the dataset. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the
information appears in the discussion item, so that you can practice tidying and
transformations as described below.
 Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to
tidy and transform your data. [Most of your grade will be based on this step!]
 Perform the analysis requested in the discussion item.
 Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include
narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions.
