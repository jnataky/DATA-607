# FALL2020TIDYVERSE
CUNY DATA 607 TIDYVERSE Collaborative project

This tidyverse recipe called "J_recipe" is a vignette for dplyr and stringir 
packages.
I explored five main verbs of dyplr that heps solving challenges in data manipulation, 
and 8 of stringir making strings manipulation much easier.
